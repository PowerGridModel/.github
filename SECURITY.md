## Supported Versions

This project uses a rolling release strategy. A new push(merge) to the `main` branch will trigger GitHub Actions to automatically release a new version. **All the bug fixes will be committed directly into the `main` branch and published in the latest release. 
No effort will be spent on backporting bug fixes to previous versions!**

| Version            | Supported          |
