## How to report a bug

This project manages bug and enhancement using the GitHub issue tracker. 
The various issue templates will guide you on making an effective report.

### Input data validity check

In many cases the problem is in the input data. 
We have an extensive input data validity check to help you with this.
Please refer to the [data validator documentation](https://power-grid-model.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_manual/data-validator.html)
and [this example notebook](https://power-grid-model.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Validation%20Examples.html) for details.

### Dump input/output data

To effectively report an issue we need a data dump of input and output.
Please refer to [this example notebook](https://power-grid-model.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Make%20Test%20Dataset.html) on how to do it.
