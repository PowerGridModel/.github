# Power Grid Model

Power Grid Model is an open-source project for steady-state distribution power system analysis.
Currently, it supports the following calculations:

* Symmetric and asymmetric power flow calculation with Newton-Raphson method, iterative current method and linear method
* Symmetric and asymmetric state estimation with iterative linear method
