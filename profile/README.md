[![License: MPL2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MPL2.0-informational.svg)](../LICENSE)

Power Grid Model is a high-performance open-source project for steady-state distribution power system analysis.

For transimission grid calculation, please refer to the [powsybl](https://www.powsybl.org/) project.

Find the latest information on the project on `TODO: the project's website`.

The calculation core package `power-grid-model` is available at [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/power-grid-model/), 
with its [documentation](https://power-grid-model.readthedocs.io/).

The data conversion package `power-grid-model-io` is available at [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/power-grid-model-io/),

## Description

To face the challenges of the energy transition, many statistical and machine learning methods are required for distribution power system analysis, which usually requires power system calculations (preferably in parallel) for a substantial number of simulation cases/scenarios.

This project matches this above by providing with following strengths:

- Optimized algorithms for the characteristics of the distribution grid.
- Full support of three-phase asymmetric calculation.
- Efficient C++ implementation with native parallel computing support.
